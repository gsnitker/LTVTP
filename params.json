  "body": "### The Long-term Vulnerability and Transformation Project (LTVTP)\r\nThe Long-term Vulnerability and Transformation Project (LTVTP) uses the deep time of the archaeological record to develop general understandings of factors that contribute to resilience and vulnerability, to stability and transformation, and to the characteristics of various types of change, including transformations, that are costly and/or painful to the people and environments involved. It draws on the resilience perspective, as well as on recent literature on robustness-vulnerability tradeoffs. A recently funded initiative of the LTVPT project builds upon this research by examining how social and ecological diversity interact to influence the resilience of societies facing major changes in their social or environmental circumstances. The goal is to discover configurations of diversity in ecological landscapes and in forms of social organization that make systems more or less able to cope with significant environmental or social changes without undergoing an unpleasant transformation.\r\n\r\n### The specific R scripts available for download include:\r\n\r\nLTVTP Anti-Correlation Script v.16\r\n\r\n\r\nLTVTP Storage Shortfall Script v.3\r\n\r\n\r\nLTVTP Wild Plant Species Richness Script v.5\r\n\r\n###### Please click the icons at the top of this page to begin the download\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: The species models required for the LTVTP Wild Plant Species Richness Script v.5 are available by request.
